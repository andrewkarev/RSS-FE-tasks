        <p class="about__content-text text">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 cats on our hands and statistics show
          that only 20% of them will find a family. The others will continue to live with us and will be waiting for a
          lucky chance to become dearly loved.</p>
        <p class="about__content-text text">We feed our wards with the best food and make sure that they do not get
          sick, feel comfortable (including psychologically) and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers and 28
          employees of various skill levels. About 12% of the animals are taken by the shelter staff. Taking care of the
          animals, they become attached to the pets and would hardly ever leave them alone.</p>
